# KOAK - Advanced Functional Programming

KOAK is the last project of EPITECH's functional programming major.

You need to implement a compiler of the KOAK language which is a simplified version of the original [Kaleidoscope Language](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html).

In order to validate the project, students must perform the following sequence of steps:
1. Parsing/Lexing
2. Building AST
3. Inferring Types
4. Code Compilation
